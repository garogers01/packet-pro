Opening
- something interesting
- whats the problem
- why we want to solve it
- using DPDK, overview

New Framework
- needed multiple apps
- shared code so make framework to abstract complexities from user
- show shot of c vs java code

Implementation
- affinity threads - use diagrams to show difference between using them and not
				   - why use them, adv vs dis
- data sharing - 4 diagrams showing difference
			   - graphs showing results
			   - actual solution implementation - packet code
			   - unsafe access abstraction for endianess, type conversion etc
			   - packing structs
- stats
- overall solution - benefits, receivepoller, packetsender, freeer, multithreaded

Results
- pktgen worked good
- packet throughput seemed to be the limit
- firewall - what was the problem

After stuff
- is anything working?

\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Time Plan}
The given time plan outlined below provides me with a useful indication of how to measure the progress of the project, as well as dividing the whole project into smaller, more manageable sections which can be assessed individually. Some of the milestones have already been completed, while the others are expected to be finished within the given time period.
\subsubsection{Key Milestones}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Done - Background reading on DPDK \& Netmap
	\item Done - Understand workings off Java Native Interface (JNI) and Java memory
	\item Done - Get DPDK (and associated programs) working on local machine (or VM)
	\item In Progress - Link DPDK library with shared object files for JNI
	\item Awaiting - Implement basic IP address firewall
	\item Awaiting - Implement basic NAT
	\item Awaiting - Find similar implementations of firewall and NAT in C/C++ and Java
	\item Awaiting - Set up 2 independent machines to use for testing purposes
	\item Awaiting - Run tests on firewall and NAT to produces performance measurements
	\item Awaiting - Analyse results
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Completed Milestones}
As indicated, the background reading on the DPDK and Netmap libraries has been completed and the overview of the implementation has been assessed. The pros and cons has been outlined in the background section (give number). From this, I was able to get DPDK fully working on a virtual machine running locally on a personal machine, which allowed for a more in depth analysis of the implementation of DPDK. \\
\newline
I'm currently working on a way to generate shared object files from the C code used the link DPDK with a Java application. Due to the complex build system which DPDK makes use of, there has been a number of issues which have arisen.

\subsection{Fall Back Position}
If a number of unforeseen issues arise which impact on the progress of the project, I've outlined a few of the key milestones which can be omitted in order to allow the project to still be evaluated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement basic NAT
	\item Find similar implementations of firewall and NAT in C/C++ and Java
	\item Run tests on firewall and NAT to produces performance measurements
\end{itemize}
Obviously, the emission of the above milestones will result in a less accurate evaluation of the overall project, but it's better than having nothing to evaluate in the end. As seen above, limiting the testing to one type of middlebox (only the firewall) can still give good results. This therefore reduces the need to look for an implementation for the NAT in Java and C/C++, while meaning less tests will have to be carried out. I feel that the remaining milestones are definitely key to the project in order for an adequate evaluation to be carried out.

\subsection{Possible Extensions}
If time allows, there are a number of possible extensions which can be undertaken to advance the project further forward and produce more data which can be evaluated later.

\subsubsection{Off Heap Java Memory}
In order for DPDK to handle packets correctly, it has to insert these packets onto the outgoing 'ring'. To do this, the Java application has to place its serialised objects into memory which DPDK can access. Under the current implementation, the Java application will directly place the packets onto the 'ring' using the direct ByteBuffer allocate feature. The other option is to use off heap java memory which DPDK can access and place onto the 'ring' automatically. This off heap memory is slightly slower than on heap memory but much faster than disk memory, while off heap memory stores object serialised and therefore ready for transmission in packets. \\
\newline
Altering the application to make use of off heap Java memory and then testing the results could potentially offer a new and faster way of high performance packet processing in Java.

\subsubsection{Limit Testing}
Another interesting extension could be to test the limitations of the NAT and firewall applications implemented within this project, and therefore limitations of the underlaying implementation. In terms of the project, the limitations could be on the max packet throughput which it can handle without having to buffer the incoming packets.

\todo[inline]{extension to remove packet pointer passing and do it directly from struct array - would have to dynamically pack array though - how????}

\subsection{Future Work}

\subsection{extrapolate for other non-native languages}
A number of other programming languages such as Visual Basic (.NET) and C\# use similar a virtual machine just like Java to make them portable to other machines. This gives the opportunity to extrapolate certain high-level implementation details and apply them to other non-native programming languages, allowing for other application not written in Java to take advantage of fast non-native packet processing. \todo{continue this, where should it go?}
